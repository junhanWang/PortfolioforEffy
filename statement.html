    <h5> ARTIST STATEMENT </h5>
  </div>

  <div id="artcontext">
<p>The medium that I use used to be canvas and oil painting, however I learned illustrator and adobe series apps, my medium changed to digital. I think digital materials allows us to explore more of the potential of an art work, and it is more precise than human eyes. Many projects of mine cannot be finished without using digital materials. I am now studying graphic design and hoping to work in graphic design field, I chose this because I think graphic design is a huge net that covers almost everything around us, notice or not, it is so subtle and vastly used that sometimes we don’t even know that we are already inside the beauty of graphic design. Like the poster of the movie, the covers of books, even to one logo is involved in graphic design. It would be pretty honorable if some corporation or someone is using my design, it means they are appreciating and approving my work..

Take ’in design ‘ for example, it is using to design books and magazine. I took a introductory course of software, and the final project was to design my own color theory magazine. Everything was based on our style and free creation. I spent days to design the rags, setting, and covers, finally when I printed the whole book out and bind it, it was so satisficing to see one thing you design on computer actually became a product, even it’s not for sale purpose, it was just a project, but still it was designed and manufactured by me.
That’s why I enjoy and would be involved in this industry.
